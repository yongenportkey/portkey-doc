# Security Mechanism

![Security Mechanism](/img/security-mechanism.png)

In the past, the primary security concerns of Web3 wallets focused on two aspects: the management of users' wallet private keys and the possibility of recovering a lost wallet. Smart contract wallets, or CA wallets, have made significant breakthroughs in these areas. The core technologies behind this breakthrough are the Virtual Address technology employed by the Portkey CA wallet and the decentralized identity (DID) solution developed based on this technology, along with the advanced social recovery mechanism.  
Firstly, regarding the management of private keys, unlike exchange wallets where users' private keys are passively hosted on exchange platforms, or non-custodial EOA wallets like Metamask where users' private keys are stored directly on their local devices and require complex mnemonic phrases for memorization, the Portkey CA wallet decouples users' accounts and private keys through the Portkey DID design. After users undergo identity verification, they are assigned a Manager Address through the Portkey smart contract. This Manager Address is responsible for managing users' private keys. Additionally, user identity verification is conducted through decentralized guardians, which act as protectors of users' private keys.  
After users register accounts using their mobile phones, email, or other social accounts, if they attempt to log into the wallet on a new device, they need to undergo identity verification by the pre-set guardians. The identity verification rules consist of two parts:

1. Users' creation or login of the Portkey CA wallet needs to be approved by guardians. When users request approval from guardians, they first send verification code requests to decentralized verifiers. After the verifiers successfully verify the user's verification code, they provide signatures to the guardians. Once a sufficient number of signatures have been collected, user's identity will be verified and their creation or login of the wallet will be approved.
2. If the number of guardians does not exceed 3, all guardians' approvals are required for account login. When the number of guardians surpasses 3, it requires approvals from more than (3/5 \*N) guardians, rounded down and plus 1, to gain control over the wallet account.

These steps allow users to log into the CA wallet without needing mnemonic phrases, using Web2 social information. This naturally eliminates the single point of failure associated with losing mnemonic phrases. Furthermore, the decentralized guardian mechanism mitigates the risk of centralized custody of private keys.
Additionally, in the event of a user's wallet-associated device being lost, the user can recover the wallet through social recovery. After completing the decentralized identity verification process mentioned above, users can choose to remove login permissions from old or suspicious devices, thereby mitigating risks and regaining control over their wallet.
Overall, the Portkey CA wallet, through its core decentralized identity (DID) and social recovery features, offers the following advantages in terms of Web3 wallet security:

  <li>
    1. Total self-custody <br /> Unlike crypto exchange wallet where users'
    private keys are in the hands of the exchanges, with Portkey CA wallet, a
    user's private key is stored in his or her local devices and safeguarded by
    decentralized guardians giving the user total self-custody of his or her
    key.
  </li>
  <li>
    2. Socially recoverable <br /> Unlike non-custodial EOA wallets, where users
    have to memorize their own private keys, and once they lose the keys, they
    lose the wallets for good. Portkey CA wallet eliminates this risk of
    singular point making the wallets recoverable resorting to guardians and
    verifiers
  </li>
  <li>
    3. More immune to hacks <br />
    Unlike non-custodial EOA wallets, where private keys lack extra protection and
    are easy to be hacked, Portkey CA wallet safeguards users wallets with a number
    of guardians making it much more immune to hacks
  </li>
  <li>
    4. Absolutely decentralised <br />
    The guardians and verifiers playing important roles in social recovery process
    of Portkey are decentralised, making the wallet completely decentralised as well.
