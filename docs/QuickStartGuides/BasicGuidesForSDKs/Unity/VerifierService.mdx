# Verifier Service

## Overview

When users create an account or add a guardian, verifier services are needed to verify the account. 

Verifier services are provided by external verification providers during the authentication process for social recovery. These verifiers offer verification options such as Email, SMS OTP, Google, or Apple verification in a decentralised manner. The introduction of verifers aims to enhance the overall security of social recovery in Portkey and allows users to customise the level of decentralisation for their accounts.

Verifier services encompass functions such as recording, sending, and verifying verification codes as well as validating signatures.

1.  Users initiate guardian account requests through the frontend to the proxy Guardian Verifier service, such as emails or phone numbers.

1.  The proxy Guardian Verifier service handles this request:

    1.  If the request is successfully sent, it returns to the frontend with a success confirmation and VerifierSessionId.
    1.  If the request fails, it returns with an error code and error message.

1.  Users send the received verification code to the backend proxy Guardian Verifier service through the frontend.

1.  The backend proxy Guardian Verifier service forwards the verification code:

    1.  If the verification succeeds, it returns the verification file and signature file to the frontend.
    1.  If the verification fails, it returns an error code and error message to the frontend.

This is automatically done in code and developers do not need to worry about implementing.
