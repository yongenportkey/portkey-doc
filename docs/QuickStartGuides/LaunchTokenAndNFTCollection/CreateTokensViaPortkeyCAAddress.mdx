# Create Tokens via Portkey CA Address

## 1. Obtain SEED

Refer to [Obtain SEED](docs/QuickStartGuides/LaunchTokenAndNFTCollection/ObtainSEED.mdx)

## 2. Create token

Create by using ManagerForwardCall in the **CA contract** and calling the **Token contract**.

Please note: the contract called is on the MainChain but you can decide to create tokens whether on the MainChain or SideChains via the parameter **issue_chain_id (issueChainId in the below demo).**

### Obtain chain information

You can use the methods below to query each chain's info and the info about the CA contract or Token contract. Select MainChain AELF as the token creation chain.

```typescript
import { did } from '@portkey/did';
const chainList = await did.services.getChainsInfo();
```

### Obtain wallet information

Please note: the Portkey account should be logged in.

```typescript
import { did } from '@portkey/did';

const { wallet } = did.didWallet.managementAccount;
```

### Initialize contract

```typescript
import { getContractBasic } from '@portkey/contracts';

const contract = await getContractBasic({
  contractAddress: TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, // MultiToken contract address
  account: wallet, // Provide the wallet info from the last step
  callType: 'ca', // Set the initialising contract type as CA contract
  caContractAddress: 'CA contract address',
  caHash:  did.didWallet.caInfo.AELF.caHash, // CaHash of the account
  rpcUrl: 'aelf blockchain node address'
});  
```

### Create by calling contract methods

For parameter details, refer to contract documentation: https://docs.aelf.io/en/latest/reference/smart-contract-api/multi-token.html

Create by using the `callSendMethod` method in the **CA contract** and calling the **Token contract**.

```typescript
const { data: { TransactionId } } = await contract.callSendMethod('Create', wallet.address, {
    symbol: 'TEST TOKEN',
    tokenName: 'TEST TOKEN NAME',
    totalSupply: 'Total amount of tokens can be created',
    decimals: 'token decimals',
    issuer: 'Target issuer address',
    isBurnable: 'Set the token to be burnable or not',
    issueChainId: 'ID of the chain where the token will be issued',
});
```

## 3. Issue

Issue by using the `callSendMethod` method in the **CA contract** and calling the **Token contract**.

```typescript
const result = await contract.callSendMethod('Issue', wallet.address, {
  symbol: 'TEST TOKEN',
  to: 'Target issuer' ,
  amount: 'Total amount of tokens can be issued'
});
```

## Process of Portkey account creating tokens

### CA operation --- set MainChain as issue_chain_id

### CA operation --- set SideChain as issue_chain_id

Operations on the SideChain can only take effect when the MainChain and SideChain are synchronized.
